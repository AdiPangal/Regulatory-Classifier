The suggestions focus on reinforcing these critical instructions through stronger emphasis, clearer distinctions, and a mandatory self-review step. This aims to reduce misclassifications by ensuring the model processes information more systematically and accurately according to the defined hierarchy and PII sensitivity levels. The explicit clarification for driver's license numbers directly addresses a common misclassification observed in the feedback, which was a significant contributor to 'Confidential -> Highly Sensitive' errors. The added 'FINAL CLASSIFICATION REVIEW' acts as a cognitive forcing function, prompting the model to double-check its application of the most frequently missed or misapplied rules.",

    "reason": "Auto-applied: The revised prompt directly addresses the feedback by introducing a dedicated 'Confidential' classification step (STEP 2). This new step clarifies the criteria for internal, proprietary, and less critical PII (like driver's licenses), which were previously a source of misclassification (e.g., driver's licenses being incorrectly labeled Highly Sensitive, or internal memos being missed entirely, as seen in IDs 8, 12, 16, 17). The 'COMMON PITFALLS' section has been updated to be more concise and specifically highlight the observed errors and provide explicit instructions to prevent them, particularly emphasizing the distinction between Confidential and Highly Sensitive PII to resolve both over- and under-classification issues. The definition of 'Highly Sensitive' (STEP 3) has been made more precise and restrictive, focusing only on the most critical data types, which should reduce over-classification and ensure truly sensitive data (indicated by the 'Confidential -> Highly Sensitive' corrections) is correctly identified. The priority of the 'Public' classification (STEP 1) for marketing materials, even with PII, is also reinforced, addressing the 'Highly Sensitive -> Public' misclassification (ID 5). The explicit sequential evaluation order ('STOP AT FIRST MATCH') is critical to ensure these refined rules are applied effectively, preventing lower-priority classifications from overriding higher-priority ones.",

Focus primarily on the document's *purpose and intended audience*.\n- If the document is a marketing brochure, product catalog, promotional material, advertisement, press release, or public-facing content designed to attract customers or inform the general public, classify as **Public** IMMEDIATELY.\n- **CRITICAL: IGNORE keywords like 'proprietary', 'nda', 'confidential' if this is marketing material - these are boilerplate legal text and DO NOT override the Public classification for marketing content.**\n- Marketing materials are Public **EVEN IF** they contain names, addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses used as public contact points.\n- **EXAMPLE:** A product brochure listing sales contact names and phone numbers is Public.\n\n**STEP 2: Is this CONFIDENTIAL internal, proprietary, or basic sensitive information?**\n- Evaluate if the document contains information that is not intended for public disclosure but does NOT contain the specific highly sensitive data defined in Step 3.\n- This includes information that is explicitly marked 'Internal Use Only', 'Proprietary', 'Confidential', or by its nature is restricted to internal personnel.\n- This includes:\n    - Internal communications (e.g., internal memos, company-only reports, internal meeting minutes, internal financial reports *without* highly sensitive PII).\n    - Proprietary business information (e.g., trade secrets, business strategies, financial projections *without* highly sensitive PII).\n    - Non-public legal documents (e.g., internal legal advice, contract drafts before public release).\n    - Sensitive PII that is NOT 'Highly Sensitive' (e.g., **driver's license numbers**, employee IDs, non-public contact lists, basic internal financial figures *without* SSNs/CCs/Bank accounts).\n    - Defense or military information (unless it contains critical PII making it Highly Sensitive).\n- **CRITICAL: Driver's license numbers, employee IDs, and general internal communications are ALWAYS Confidential, NOT Highly Sensitive.**\n- If the document matches these criteria, classify as **Confidential** IMMEDIATELY.\n\n**STEP 3: Is this HIGHLY SENSITIVE critical personal or corporate data?**\n- Look *only* for the *most critical and explicitly defined* personal identifying information (PII) or highly sensitive corporate financial/security data.\n- **CRITICAL: DO NOT classify information from Step 1 or Step 2 as Highly Sensitive. If it fits an earlier category, STOP there.**\n- This includes:\n    - Social Security Numbers (SSNs).\n    - Full Credit Card Numbers (PANs).\n    - Bank Account Numbers and Routing Numbers.\n    - Complete Employment Applications or Resumes (which contain a combination of the most sensitive PII).\n    - Health Information (PHI).\n    - Biometric data.\n    - Highly sensitive corporate security credentials or access keys (e.g., encryption keys, root passwords).\n- **CRITICAL: Driver's license numbers are NOT Highly Sensitive. Internal memos are NOT Highly Sensitive unless they contain the specific critical PII listed above.**\n- If the document contains any of these, classify as **Highly Sensitive** IMMEDIATELY.\n\n**STEP 4: Default Classification**\n- If the document does not match any of the above categories, classify as **Public**.",
    "reason": "Auto-applied: The changes directly address the identified issues:\n\n1.  **Hierarchy Violation / 'STOP AT FIRST MATCH' Failure:**\n    *   The prompt now starts with a stronger, more explicit warning: `STRICT ADHERENCE TO HIERARCHY IS MANDATORY. FAILURE TO STOP AT THE FIRST MATCH IS A CRITICAL ERROR.` This aims to increase the model's adherence to the sequential order.\n    *   In Step 3, `CRITICAL: DO NOT classify information from Step 1 or Step 2 as Highly Sensitive. If it fits an earlier category, STOP there.` explicitly reinforces that earlier matches take precedence, directly combating the tendency to over-classify as Highly Sensitive.\n\n2.  **PII Mis-categorization:**\n    *   A new `COMMON MISCLASSIFICATION CORRECTIONS TO LEARN FROM` section prominently highlights key distinctions, including `DRIVER'S LICENSES ARE CONFIDENTIAL, NOT HIGHLY SENSITIVE:` and `DISTINGUISH PII CAREFULLY:`. This serves as a high-level, prioritized reminder.\n    *   In Step 2 (Confidential), `CRITICAL: Driver's license numbers, employee IDs, and general internal communications are ALWAYS Confidential, NOT Highly Sensitive.` is added for clarity.\n    *   In Step 3 (Highly Sensitive), the instruction is refined to `Look *only* for the *most critical and explicitly defined*` and a critical negative constraint `CRITICAL: Driver's license numbers are NOT Highly Sensitive. Internal memos are NOT Highly Sensitive unless they contain the specific critical PII listed above.` is added. This directly addresses the misclassification of driver's licenses and internal memos as Highly Sensitive.\n\n3.  **Marketing Material Identification Failure:**\n    *   The `COMMON MISCLASSIFICATION CORRECTIONS TO LEARN FROM` section includes `MARKETING IS ALWAYS PUBLIC:` with emphasis on purpose/audience, directly addressing feedback #5.\n    *   Step 1 (Public) now includes a concrete `EXAMPLE: A product brochure listing sales contact names and phone numbers is Public.` This provides an unambiguous illustration of marketing material containing PII that still classifies as Public, helping the model apply the 'purpose and audience' rule correctly.\n\n4.  **Under-detection of Confidentiality Cues:**\n    *   Step 2 (Confidential) now explicitly mentions `This includes information that is explicitly marked 'Internal Use Only', 'Proprietary', 'Confidential', or by its nature is restricted to internal personnel.` This provides more direct keyword cues for identifying confidential documents, addressing feedback #8 and #12 where internal documents were missed.",

    "reason": "Auto-applied: The revised prompt addresses the identified issues by significantly reinforcing the hierarchical classification and 'STOP AT FIRST MATCH' directive, making it more explicit and unavoidable. The 'URGENT CORRECTIONS' section is made more impactful and directly addresses the most common misclassifications, particularly the primacy of marketing content and the correct classification of driver's licenses.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1.  **Hierarchy and Stopping:** The `CRITICAL DIRECTIVE` is more forceful, and `IMMEDIATELY. **STOP HERE.**` is added to the end of each classification step to ensure the model explicitly halts its evaluation. Conditional `If you did NOT classify it as...` statements at the beginning of Steps 2 and 3 further enforce sequential processing.\n\n2.  **Public Classification:** Step 1 is strengthened by emphasizing `PRIMARY CRITERION: Focus on the document's *purpose and intended audience*` and adding a new `CRITICAL RULE` that marketing content's public nature **OVERRIDES** the presence of contact PII. The 'URGENT CORRECTIONS' section now prominently states `If it's marketing, it CANNOT be classified as Confidential or Highly Sensitive` to act as a strong negative filter.\n\n3.  **PII Distinction:** The prompt now uses clearer language in the 'URGENT CORRECTIONS' section to `DISTINGUISH PII CAREFULLY (Confidential vs. Highly Sensitive)`. In Step 2, `SENSITIVE PII that is NOT 'Highly Sensitive'` is a new sub-section with explicit examples, including the critical reiteration that `Driver's license numbers (CRITICAL: ALWAYS Confidential, NEVER Highly Sensitive).` In Step 3, a strong negative constraint `CRITICAL: If the document contains ONLY information that would have qualified it for Step 1 or Step 2... you have made an error and must re-evaluate` acts as a guardrail against over-classification to Highly Sensitive.\n\n4.  **Readability and Emphasis:** More strategic use of bolding, capitalization, and explicit `CRITICAL` tags throughout the prompt draws attention to the most important rules and common pitfalls. The rephrased 'Urgent Corrections' convey a stronger imperative for the model to learn from past mistakes.\n\nThese changes aim to reduce ambiguity, force a stricter adherence to the classification logic, and prevent the model from over-indexing on keywords or PII without proper contextual evaluation and hierarchical priority.",
